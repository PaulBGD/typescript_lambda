This project is terrible.  TypeScript as a project does not have any way of
calling to their lib without going to the command line (thus forking) which we
don't want to do.  So, we have projects like `typescript-simple`, included in
the package.json.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
node run_locally.js
```
